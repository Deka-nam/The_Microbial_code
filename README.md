# The_Microbial_code
The Microbial Code is a Bioinformatics Initiative stared by me to upskill bioinformatics skills of the students of Biomedical Sciences. Here, I log all the documentation and modules used for the various training sessions. 

- If you'd like to learn along with the group, you can start by reviewing **1. Docs > Intro to Linux pt1 and pt2**
- Next is understanding the **2. Structure of databases and example module exercises** 
- **3. Project Management** folder has guidelines on how to brainstorm project ideas for bioinformatics that does the dual function of learning bioinformatics pipelines and finding meaningful biological insights.

__Hence the name, use code to decode **THE MICROBIAL CODE**__
