# Project Planning 

## Typical Project Stages
1. **Question Formulation**: Define clear biological questions. If the biological question is unclear, the methods won't be usable 
2. **Data Acquisition**: Find or generate appropriate datasets
3. **Quality Control**: Assess data quality and preprocess. **Very Important Step** Because _garbage in = garbage out_
4. **Analysis**: Apply appropriate tools and pipelines. There are many to choose from. So, a good literature review with pros and cons of the tools and pipelines is important. 
5. **Interpretation**: Extract biological insights from results. **This is the most fun if everything goes well and gets you hooked to bioinformatics!!** 
6. **Communication**: Share findings through reports/publications

#### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
-  Taking on too much at once
- **Poor documentation**: Forgetting how analysis was done
- **Insufficient QC**: Building analysis on poor quality data. Because again, _garbage in = garbage out_
- **Tool obsession**: Focusing on tools rather than biological questions

#### Why Collaboration Matters
- Bioinformatics projects often require multiple expertise areas
- Division of labor increases efficiency
- Peer review improves quality
- Shared knowledge accelerates learning

### Exercise 2: Setting Up Collaborative Workspace

#### Initialize Project Repository
```bash
# Create project directory structure
mkdir -p my_project/{data,scripts,results,docs}

# Create essential files
touch my_project/README.md
touch my_project/scripts/analysis_pipeline.sh
touch my_project/docs/protocol.md

# Create data manifest
cat > my_project/data/manifest.csv << 'EOF'
sample_id,data_type,source,accession,download_date
sample1,genome,NCBI,GCF_XXXX,
sample2,genome,NCBI,GCF_XXXX,
EOF
```

#### Establish Analysis Protocol
```bash
# Create basic analysis script template
cat > my_project/scripts/00_setup.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Project: [Project Name]
# Setup script - run first

# Set project directories
PROJECT_DIR=$(pwd)
DATA_DIR="$PROJECT_DIR/data"
SCRIPTS_DIR="$PROJECT_DIR/scripts"
RESULTS_DIR="$PROJECT_DIR/results"

# Create subdirectories
mkdir -p $DATA_DIR/{raw,processed}
mkdir -p $RESULTS_DIR/{qc,assembly,annotation}

# Log setup
echo "Project setup completed: $(date)" > $PROJECT_DIR/setup.log
EOF

chmod +x my_project/scripts/00_setup.sh
```

### Exercise 3: Workflow Documentation

## Pro Tips for Successful Projects

1. **Start small** - get a minimal analysis working first, then expand
2. **Document everything** - you'll forget details faster than you think
3. **Divide work clearly** - assign specific responsibilities to each team member
4. **Meet regularly** - weekly check-ins prevent drift and keep momentum
5. **Celebrate milestones** - recognize progress to maintain motivation

## Next Steps

With these modules complete, your group is ready to:
1. **Select 1-2 projects** from your brainstorming session
2. **Form teams** around the selected projects
3. **Begin detailed planning** using the templates provided
4. **Start acquiring data** and setting up analysis pipelines
5. **Schedule regular check-ins** to track progress and troubleshoot issues

Remember: The goal is not just to complete analyses, but to build collaborative skills and produce meaningful biological insights!
